# Motivational Puppy Meme Generator

## Udacity - Intermediate Python Nanodegree

The goal of this project is to build a "meme generator"—a multimedia application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote. It’s not that simple though! Your content team spent countless hours writing quotes in a variety of filetypes. You could manually copy and paste these quotes into one standard format – but you’re going to over-engineer a solution to load quotes from each file to show off your fancy new Python skills.
